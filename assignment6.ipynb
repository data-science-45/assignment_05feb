    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behavior of a group of similar objects. A class is like a template or a blueprint that defines the common features and functions of all objects that belong to that class. An object is an instance of a class that has a specific state and behavior. An object is any entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a Laptop is a class that defines the common features and functions of all laptops, while a laptop of company XYZ is an object of the Laptop class."
